Easy Photo Gallery
==================

By Gareth Owenson (http://owenson.me)

**Features**
- Very easy, two steps to get up and running.
- Extremely fast even for large numbers of images.

It's easy, place your original prints in the prints folder and run 
genthumbs.sh (ensure you have imagemagick installed).

That's it - now visit in a web browser.  If you want maximal speed then use the
PHP file to generate the HTML file and serve that instead of the PHP file - it's not needed.
